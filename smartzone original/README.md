# SmartZone - Mobile & Gadget Store (Static Front-end)

Problem Statement:
Create a responsive static e-commerce front-end that demonstrates product browsing, filtering, and a client-side shopping cart using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery.

How to open:
1. Unzip `smartzone.zip`.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Structure:
/smartzone/
  index.html
  products.html
  product.html
  cart.html
  about.html
  contact.html
  404.html
  css/style.css
  js/app.js
  js/products.js
  img/ (placeholder images)
  assets/

Notes & Limitations:
- Static site only; no backend or database.
- Cart persisted in browser `localStorage`.
- Images are placeholders.
- Product data lives in `js/products.js`.
